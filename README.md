# What are the relationships between Dementia and its associated symptoms and treatments, and how does the prevalence of this disease vary globally?

Our webpage homepage starts by defining dementia and listing the different types that exist. It also delves into the signs and symptoms of dementia presented in an interactive manner and potential dementia risk factors.

Our “Learn about Current treatments” tab presents a neck bar graph of the types of drugs used to treat dementia and their roles in function. You can click on each data point of this graph to get further information on the drug and its function. The data to make this graph is extracted from Wikidata using a SPARQL query. 

The “Prevalence of Dementia” page interactively shows regional estimates of dementia from 2015 to 2035. This geospatial visualization is a Buuble map, where the prevalence is portrayed according to bubble size, and the most affected regions have darker colours. The data for this visualisation is extracted from Wikidata using a SPARQL query. 
 You can click on each region affected for further information

Lastly, the “Relevant Sources” tab provides more informative links for curious web page users who want to learn more about dementia. The authors' contact information will also be available on this tab.
